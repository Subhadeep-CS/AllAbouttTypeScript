## Introduction to TypeScript
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static types to the language. It enhances developer productivity by enabling rich tooling experiences, catching type-related bugs early in the development process, and allowing for easier maintenance of large codebases.

## Getting Started

To start exploring TypeScript, make sure you have TypeScript installed:

## bash

# npm install -g typescript

## Clone this repository to get all the examples and projects:

## bash

# git clone https://github.com/your-username/AllAboutTypeScript.git
# cd AllAboutTypeScript

1. Basic Types: Learn about TypeScript's primitive data types like number, string, boolean, etc.
2. Type Annotations: Understand how to explicitly specify types for variables, functions, and interfaces.
3. Interfaces and Classes: Explore how TypeScript supports object-oriented programming concepts.
4. Generics: Discover how to write reusable code with generics.
